# Lab 12 - ArrayLists

Complete the three methods described to get some practice using ArrayLists.

First, create two ArrayLists.  One will hold Integers while the other will hold Strings.  Use the names and the values shown in the comments.

Second, make sure you have the proper import statements.

Third, complete the following methods.  Uncomment the appropriate code in `main` to test.  You may modify the code in `main`.

`sumList()`
Complete this method so that it returns the sum of the list of integers.

`listMax()`
Complete this method so that it returns the largest value in the list of integers.

`removeMatching()`
